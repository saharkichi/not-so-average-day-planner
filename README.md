The main concept behind this project was to produce an effective work schedule planner to help plan your day effectively! The idea was to have a full days work hour schedule
laid out and coloured rows to show the hours that have not yet past throughout the day. There was also a 'saveable' component necessary to add so when you refresh the page, 
whatever you typed in the row, it would stil be there. A fun activity that I could see myself using in the future!
